## Improvements 

**1. This ``webapp`` module can be improved multiple ways**
**2. Using server/agent model will help us to manage node from single place.** 
**3. Can install other modules which are not added for excersise purpose. IF we add forge modules, creating and developing module is easy to develop manifests.** 
**4. Bulit in puppet module and hiera versions are very old and has lot bugs that can be fixed if we are using latest one.**
**5. Instead of downloading image, if we have our own image (snapshot) that we can add users and ssh-keys before servers are up**
**6. Firewall rules can be added and block ports/services which are not required.**
