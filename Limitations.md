#Limitations

**1. Puppet agent installation will not be easily test in remote user and require puppet server to manage agents. Need to build puppet infrastructure for testing. So I have chosen puppet apply provision for this exercise.** 

**2. his VM supported ``Puppet agent`` version is 3.4.3,  Current Puppet version is 6. So it doesn't have lot of new feature.** 

**3. This puppet version is having ``hiera`` 1.3.0 (current ``hiera`` version 5). This is initial version and had lot bugs. So I haven't chosen hiera for this exercise.**
